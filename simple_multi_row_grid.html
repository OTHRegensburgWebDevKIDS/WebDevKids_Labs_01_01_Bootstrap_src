                    Daenerys is the only daughter and youngest child of King Aerys II Targaryen, the "Mad King", and his
                    sister-wife Rhaella. Her father died during the Sack of King's Landing, before she was even born.
                    The usurper Robert Baratheon installed himself as king, having defeated Aerys in the conquest known
                    as Robert's Rebellion. Her pregnant mother and young brother Viserys, fled to the island of
                    Dragonstone, the ancestral home of House Targaryen, to escape Robert. Daenerys's brother Rhaegar
                    Targaryen was also killed in the war and Robert's forces murdered his wife and children, Daenerys's
                    sister-in-law, niece, and nephew, during the Sack of King's Landing.

                <h2>Eddard Stark (Lower-Left)</h2>
                <p>
                    Eddard Stark is the head of House Stark and Lord Paramount of the North. The North is one of the
                    constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms, and House Stark is one of the Great Houses of the realm.
                    House Stark rules the region from their seat of Winterfell, and Eddard also holds the title Lord of
                    Winterfell. In addition, he is the Warden of the North. Eddard is married to Lady Catelyn of House
                    Tully. Though they barely knew one another when they wed, they formed a strong and loving
                    marriage.[2] They have five legitimate children: Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. Eddard also has
                    an illegitimate bastard son, Jon Snow, reportedly by a common serving girl named Wylla. Jon's
                    presence at Winterfell is a source of friction between Eddard and his wife. Nevertheless, Eddard was
                    close to all his children and was well-loved and respected by all of them. He seemed to have a soft
                    spot for his youngest daughter, Arya.

                <p>
                    Catelyn was born into House Tully and is the eldest child of Lord Hoster Tully. She has a younger
                    brother, Edmure, and a younger sister, Lysa. Petyr Baelish was fostered with the Tullys and Catelyn
                    grew up with him. She was betrothed to marry Brandon Stark of Winterfell, but he was brutally
                    murdered by the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen after Prince Rhaegar had kidnapped Brandon's sister
                    Lyanna. Catelyn instead married Brandon's brother, Eddard. Though they barely knew one another when
                    they wed they have formed a strong and loving marriage. Catelyn and Eddard have five children: Robb,
                    Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. She is unhappy with Eddard's bastard son Jon Snow living with her
                    family in Winterfell, the only source of friction between her and her husband.
